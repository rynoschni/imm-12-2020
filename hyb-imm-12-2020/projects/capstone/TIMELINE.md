# Capstone Recommended Timeline

This is a _recommended_ sprint outline for your Capstone project!

## This isn't set in stone, but is provided as a guide to help keep you on track

You have roughly 2 weeks to be 100% done! This means finishing approximately 25% of the work to be done every 2-3 days.

Manage your features accordingly, and use this as a guide. Be sure to have a _ranked_ list of features, so you know what to move onto, or what to drop.

### Week 1

* **Day 1**: Organizing team, planning, feature hierarchy, create data structures
* **Day 2-3**:  Wireframes, prototypes, testing
* **Day 4-5**: Iterate, revise, release, repeat

### Week 2

* **Day 1-2**: Make sure it works, simplify, simplify.
* **Day 2-3**: Making sure it _really_ works, finalizing demo requirements.
* **Day 4**: NO NEW FEATURES!!!!
* **Day 5**: BE DEMO READY!!
