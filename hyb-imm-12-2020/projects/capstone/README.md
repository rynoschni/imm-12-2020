# Capstone Project

It's [The Final Countdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw)!!

## Requirements

* You have two weeks (and a few days) to make something incredible to show the world at Demo Day!
* Our demo day is the evening of **Monday, April 12th**.

This project is fairly open-ended, but this project should sell your technical skills to your colleagues and potential employers, so:

* It should demonstrate your technical expertise. If you want a job in web development, do a project that demonstrates your JavaScript + web stack skills.
* It should be ambitious: cookie-cutter todo apps or blogs probably won't help you land a great position.
* Start with the user-centered design process. This will help employers recognize your ability to set priorities in light of user needs!

**Heads-up**: If you don’t particate in the capstone project (or make trivial contributions and disappear), you will not receive a DigitalCrafts certificate or be a DigitalCrafts graduate.

### Note

Your technical decisions are entirely up to you. This is _your_ project. It's possible that you might choose a tech stack that is outside the Digital Crafts curriculum.  Your instructor will do whatever they can to help you, but understand that they might not have expertise with that particular tech stack.

### ➡️ Remember the [Debug Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hb3IZVcnrZQ6FXNgiqUBbqrEkRv-k1O_TFffqj3KoVs/edit?usp=sharing)!!

## Front-end Requirements

You must have a UI of some kind! But you can build using any number of technologies. Here are some ideas:

* React, React Native, ReactVR
* Hardware based (motion, gesture, or voice activated)
* Electron (HTML/CSS/JavaScript apps for the desktop)

If you are building a UI for the browser:

* `fetch` (or [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)) is recommended for AJAX.
* It must be responsive.

## Backend Requirements

* You are free to build a backend in any technology you choose! Node.js is the most obvious choice, but you are welcome to build using Python, Ruby, Java, C#/.NET, Go, Elixir, etc.
* You must have a database. PostgreSQL is recommended, but you are free to use MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, or other ones.
* It is recommended that your site is protected with an SSL certificate. (Using Certbot is the best/free choice). Projects can be hosted locally for Demo Day, but will need to be deployed after.  

## ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Important ⭐️⭐️⭐️

* You must provide DigitalCrafts with a **one-page summary** of your project with technologies used and your reasoning behind each. This should double as your _README.md_ on Github. (see note below regarding a [technical writer](#technical-writer)).
* Your final project must be publicly available on Github, include the README file, be hosted publicly, and featured on your portfolio.
* Your demo **must be recorded**. We will present these videos on Demo Day. There will _not_ be any live presentations.

### ⭐️⭐️ Demo Video Requirements ⭐️⭐️

* Present your project, think of it is as a "pitch."
* Every group member will need to speak, it's recommended to write a "script" for each person to read.
* Ryan has volunteered to help folks put this together (his group has a fantastic video to use as a reference).

## Group Requirements

2 Groups will be comprised of 4 people, one group will consist of 5 people.

* One group member will take the role of **Project Manager/Scrum Master.**
  * The PM will be the primary point of contact for each group.
  * We'll have morning stand-ups DAILY at **10:00 AM,** the group's PM will report status during standup

* <a id="technical-writer"></a>One group member will be a **Technical Writer** that is responsible for documentation for the application.
  * They will work closely with the PM to make sure the features are properly documented _as they're implemented_.

Both the Technical Writer and the PM can (and should) take an active role in development. However, these will be secondary contributions.

## ⭐️ Do and Do Not ⭐️

### DO

* Build the app around solving a problem.
* __COMMUNICATE__ early, and often!
* Keep it SIMPLE! (No swords where butter knives will do!)

### DO NOT

* Shoehorn a problem into a tech stack.
* Fall in love with your code (because it's gonna change!).
* Work in a silo and forget to talk to people.

---

## Workflow Requirements

* Create github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
* Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests).  You’ll thank yourself when things break, and employers see how well you use Github.
* On a group, the reviewer **must** code review through Github and approve before the PR can be merged. If there are no comments, the code has spaghetti, or has difficult to read spots, code review didn't happen.
* You **must** use some kind of project planning software (such as [trello.com](http://trello.com/) or Github).

## PR Rejection Criteria

* Does not fulfill feature
* Breaks other feature
* Inconsistent use of JavaScript language features (e.g. mixing `var` and `let`).
* Does not follow team's coding style/standards
* Copypasta (wholesale copying of another project without reference)
* Too many commits in a single PR (meaning too much to review)
* Code in a commit does not match commit message
* Commit message is vague
