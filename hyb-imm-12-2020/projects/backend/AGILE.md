# Agile vs Waterfall

Agile was a reaction to "waterfall" style development, where each department (business analysis, design, etc) hands off to the next department.

The problem was that there was no room for making changes after hand off. That is, you couldn't change the requirements or design, even if a feature was technically impossible or would be disliked by the users.

## Alternatives to Agile

* different flavors of software development
  * scrum
  * kanban - came from Toyota
  * eXtreme Programming

## Parts of the Agile process

### Sprints

* sprint:
  * 1 or 2 weeks
  * sprint planning: >= 1 hour
    * "what are we gonna build now?"
  * standups
    * ritual
    * cadence
    * < 15 minutes

      * is there anything blocking you?
      * what did you just work on?
      * what will you work on?
  * pairing
    * learning
    * ganging up on a tricky problem
  * review (of pull requests)
    * be overly polite
    * code review
    * retrospective
  * demo
    * show the software to a user or product owner
        * you likey? you no likey?

### Epics

* "epic"
  * "a bunch of features"
  * "fall release"
  * "version 3.4.9"

## The agile team

* product development team
  * project lead
    * makes technical decisions based on business needs
  * sales team (less involved with the day to day)
  * business/data analysts
  * developers
  * project manager
    * SCRUM master
  * software testers, QA (Quality Assurance) peeps
    * click things and type things
    * making sure the software works
  * UI/UX designers
    * User Interface - layout: cluttered vs uncluttered
      * creating (low fidelity) "wireframes"
      * high fidelity "assets"
        * assets - actual graphics/images/fonts used in the app or website
        * boxes and arrows
      * User eXperience - can the treasure be located in our puzzle?
        * users are task oriented
  * product owner ("stakeholders")
  * customers
