## We'll have DAILY stand-ups at 10:00 AM every day!

---

## Project Kickoff

* Choose one of the _Full-Stack Projects_ from this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xAX0VjURjKyQbeFm-gkMB2N_JGxnziHsDEHI6XhgsDw/edit?usp=sharing)
* **No less than 3, no more than 4, people to a project!!**
* Each team must present their project on the afternoon of February 16th.

NOTE: Project signups will be moved to the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/BosNw9ps/hyb-imm-12-2020-roadmap), but as of this morning (02/10/2021), Trello is experiencing an outage.

## Acceptance Criteria

Each project has specific guidelines that you'll need to follow. The requirements are different per project. However, here is some high level criteria to keep in mind:

### FrontEnd

* It is recommended that you _do not_ focus on CSS. Please (gently) use a library (ie. Bulma, Bootstrap, Foundation, Materialize) for your styling.
* Implement a simple Responsive Web Design that works on Chrome on OSX, iOS devices, and Android devices at 360px, 768px, and 1200+ px wide

### BackEnd

* Use Express for your HTTP framework.
* Use es6Renderer for your templating.
* Use PostgreSQL for your database

## Workflow Requirements

* Groups of 3 or 4: _No more than 4, NO SOLO_!!
* Create github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
* Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests), making sure to tag a reviewer for approval
* Reviewer must code review through Github and approve before the PR can be merged. If there are no comments, the code has spaghetti, or has difficult to read spots, code review didn't happen.
* Use a feature tracking system, such as:
  * Github project (kanban board)
  * Trello

### Suggested PR rejection criteria

* Does not fulfill feature
* Breaks other feature
* Does not follow team's coding style/standards
* Too many commits in a single PR (meaning too much to review)
* Code in a commit does not match commit message
* Commit message is vague
