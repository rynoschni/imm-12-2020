# Build a React App

React mini-projects kick off the afternoon of Tuesday, March 16th.

## Choose Your Own Adventure

* **Choose**: Stateful Components, or Functional? Or both?
* **Choose**: Hooks? No Hooks?
* **Choose**: Redux? Context? Local State?
* **Choose**: Styled Components? Bootstrap? Material UI? CSS?


## Items being forced upon you by the Seanarchy™

* Stand-up every morning at 10:00 AM EST.
  * **Zoom:** "_Good_" or "_Blocked_"
  * **Slack:** Full status: _Yesterday/Today/Blockers_
* Periodic Check-In on Slack throughout the day.
* The project is solo, but you are allowed, _and encouraged_ to collaborate with classmates
* At least **one** Component test (_remember tests?_)

## ⭐️⭐️⭐️ PROJECT IDEAS ⭐️⭐️⭐️

* Choose from [one of the following projects.](./PROJECT_IDEAS.md)

## Do and Do Not

### DO

* Build the app around solving a problem, _read the user story!_
* __COMMUNICATE__ early, and often!
* Keep it SIMPLE! (No swords where butter knives will do!)

### DO NOT

* Shoehorn a problem into a tech stack.
* Fall in love with your code (because it's gonna change!).
* Work in a silo and forget to talk to people.
