## Sean's "A Ha!" Moment

REMINDER!

> Redux is an introduction into Functional Programming. It takes _all_ `state` objects and makes them into `props`, so your components can be "dumb."

## Today

* Review [Exercise 2](../day1/EXERCISES.md#exercise-2) from yesterday.
* Start [Exercise 1](./EXERCISES.md#exercise-1) for today.

## Context is coming!

* [State Management with React Hooks and Context API in 10 lines of code!](https://medium.com/simply/state-management-with-react-hooks-and-context-api-at-10-lines-of-code-baf6be8302c)

## Solutions

* [Sean's "So Many Cats" Solution](https://github.com/seanrreid/cat-reducer-v_03_21/tree/exercise-3)
  * Initial Redux and Cat List only.
  * Does _not_ include changing activity per cat (I can't give you _all_ the answers! ðŸ˜œ).
