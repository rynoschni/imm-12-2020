# Yet ANOTHER To-Do List

We'll use this exercise to rotate through breakout groups and develop a To-Do App using Node/Express/Postgresql

## The App

Create an app to track a to-do list for a user.

## The Requirements

* A user can register/login
* Once a user is logged in, they can create a list of task
* By default, _all_ items start as incomplete.
* The user can mark items complete as they're done.

## Stretch Goals

* Mark multiple tasks compelete at once
* Duplicate a task

---

## Sprint 1

* Map out user flow/How does the app work?
* Sketch out (in notes/on paper) the following:
  * How many views?
  * What types of models?
  * What kind of routes?

## Sprint 2

* Create Database Schema
* Create a database on ElephantSQL

## Sprint 3

Scaffold out the app.

* Create your root folder.
* Install the necessary `npm` modules (refer to a previous `package.json`)
* Create all your necessary folders for the app
  * _eg_:  `views`, `models`, `routes`, `public`

Create your `index.js` (or `app.js`)

* Set a host and port number
* Make sure to load all the necessary modules
* Refer to previous examples for the required `app.use` and/or `app.set`  statements.

Create a default (aka `index.js`) route.

* Create a default route that just returns a status of 200 and the text "OK" when a user browses to your site.

## Sprint 4

Start working on the **MODELS**.  Use your database to determine how to structure these.

* Think about how many models you'll need
  * _eg_: Users Model, Tasks Model
* Think about the _methods_ you'll need for each model
  * _eg_: Users Model needs methods for registration/login/logout

## Sprint 5

Start working on the **ROUTES** (aka CONTROLLERS).

**ROUTES** + PostMan (the app) can be used to test your **MODELS**.

* Think about the kind of requests you'll need to make
* How are task related pages different from the homepage (if they are)?
* How many `POST` routes will I need?
* How many `GET` routes will I need?
* Do I need any `PUT` or `DELETE` routes?

## Sprint 6

Start working on the **VIEWS**

* What should the homepage look like?
* What does an authenticated user see?
* What does a guest see?
* How are the tasks viewed?

## Sprint 7

Does it work?

* Test out the user experience.
* Does it work as expected?
* Fix any bugs you find in the process.
