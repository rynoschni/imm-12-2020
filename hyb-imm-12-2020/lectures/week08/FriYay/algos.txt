Bubble sort!
Write a program to sort an array of numbers in ascending order, comparing and swapping two numbers at a time.
[3, 1, 4, 2] 
[1, 3, 4, 2]
[1, 3, 4, 2]
[1, 3, 2, 4]
[1, 3, 2, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]


2
Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.
For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them, and output an array of boolean values. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
candies = [2,3,5,1,3]
extraCandies = 3
Expected output: [true, true, true, false, true]


3
Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.
The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.
Return the shuffled string.
s = “odce” 
indices = [1, 2, 0, 3]
Returns “code"


4
Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.
For multiples of 3 it should output “Fizz” instead of the number
For the multiples of 5 output “Buzz” 
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 output “FizzBuzz”


5
Write a program that returns all prime numbers up to a given max.
Prime number: A number greater than 1 that is only divisible by itself and 1
