> The number 1 mistake a lot of devs make at the start of their careers is treating their code like their babies or pets.
Sure, we all love our work but always remember what your end goal is, to write good code and collectively contribute to making the product/project you are working on better every day.
When you don't attach your feelings with the code you write, there is a better chance you'll always try to make it better and not let your feelings come in way of improving it.
