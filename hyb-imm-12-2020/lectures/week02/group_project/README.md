# Group Project

## Goal

Create a Python Project! The options are 100% up to you to decide.

* Expand RPG?
* Do something entirely different?
* Use a library?

## Organization

* Groups of 3 or 4 people.
  * Be sure to add the group name/members to the class Trello board.
* Everyone speaks during the presentation!!

#### Github

* Create a primary repo.
* Add members as "Contributors" to that repo.
* Use branches!!
* Submit work from branches via Pull Request (PR).

## Day to Day

Meet every morning for morning "Stand Up" to give status report.

In your status you'll answer these three questions:

* What you did yesterday?
* What you are doing today?
* What is blocking you?

## Schedule

* Wednesday Afternoon - Plan/Design
* Thursday - Build
* Friday - Build
* Weekend - _Up to you_
* Monday Morning - Build
  * EOB on Monday - NO NEW FEATURES!!!
* Tuesday - Test, Iterate, Repeat
* Wednesday - Present


### If Interested

_Disclaimer_: Additional libraries are not required, and in many cases myself, or the DIRs might not be familiar with them. You're free to use _any_ library you'd like, but note that it will require reading the documentation thoroughly.

Some previous students have done 2D video games. There are some libraries that have been used in the past and found to bbe helpful:

#### Pyglet

* Recently Chris Aqino had some students enjoy using [Pyglet](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [_Gaming with Pyglet_ from the _Hello Python_ book](https://livebook.manning.com/book/hello-python/chapter-9/)

#### PyGame

* Other students have used [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
* Here's a [Pygame Tutorial from Real Python](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/)
