## Official React Tutorial: Tic Tac Toe

You'll create a tic tac toe game with React that has at least three components: Game, Board, and Square.

Use the official React Tutorial to walk you through the process: [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Follow the instructions for [_Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment_](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment)

### Part 1

Complete the tutorial up to _Making an Interactive Component_

When you see this below, please stop:
> Congratulations! You’ve just “passed a prop” from a parent Board component to a child Square component. Passing props is how information flows in React apps, from parents to children.

### Part 2

Complete the tutorial up to _Developer Tools_

When you see this below, please stop:
> The React DevTools let you check the props and state of your React components.

### Part 3

Complete the tutorial up through _Completing the Game_

When you see this below, please stop:
> Congratulations! You now have a working tic-tac-toe game. And you’ve just learned the basics of React too. So you’re probably the real winner here.

### Part 4

Redo the version from the React Tutorial again, from scratch. Make the following changes:

* Create a new React app with `create-react-app`
* Create a `components` folder
* Make a .jsx file for each of the components you created with the tutorial
