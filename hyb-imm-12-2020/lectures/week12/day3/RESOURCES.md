## React Design Patterns

* "Design Patterns" refers to conventions used to write the code, _not_ "design" in terms of UI, graphics, fonts, colors, etc...

> The key feature of React is composition of components. Components written by different people should work well together. It is important to us that you can add functionality to a component without causing rippling changes throughout the codebase.
