# FriYay React App Contest!!!

## The choices are yours, and yours alone...

* You will be creating a React app using the skills you've been working on this week. 
* It can be something useful or something random and fun, but you only have the morning to finish.
* Your contest submissions will be judged by a group of DigitalCrafts staff and our top 3 devs will win a _FABULOUS PRIZE!_

### Contest Rules

* Everyone must work on their OWN app - your group is for debugging and moral support.
* If your Netlify link is not posted in the class slack channel by the end of lunch (2pm EST / 1pm CST) you will be disqualified.

### App Requirements

* Use one API from [this list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).
* Use styled-components.
* Push to GitHub and deploy on Netlify.
  * _You do not need a custom domain!_
* React Router is not required (but could be a nice bonus).
